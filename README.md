TicTacToe
=========

This is a project Nicholas Vaidyanathan worked on in the Fall of 2008 in Huan Liu's Introduction to AI course. It is meant to play Tic-Tac-Toe with a player in Java. The goal is to represent the state of the game within trees and then use A* Search to have the computer choose the next best move based on the current state of the board.

It was implemented long before Nick became familiar with best practices of software engineering, such as Test Driven Development, Design Patterns, etc. Hence, it is a fertile ground to treat as Legacy Code, perfect for working through adding tests, practicing dependency breaking techniques, and refactoring.

You are invited to fork this and follow through the commit log, as we take an incomplete application written by a student and refactor it.
